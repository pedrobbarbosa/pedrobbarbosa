**Backend Developer** specialized in building scalable, resilient, and well-structured systems using **Java**, **Spring Boot**, and **SQL-based architectures**. I'm passionate about backend development, system modernization, and creating clean, maintainable code that solves real-world business challenges.

Currently working at **SergipeTec**, where I design and implement critical features for tax and financial systems in public sector environments. My focus includes optimizing legacy applications, integrating APIs, and improving system observability in high-stakes production environments.

üîç **Currently seeking international opportunities** to grow as a backend specialist and contribute to impactful products with global tech teams.

## üíº What I Do

- **API Development**: Design and develop RESTful APIs with **Java + Spring Boot**, following clean architecture and best practices
- **Legacy Modernization**: Modernize and refactor legacy systems with **Java 6**, **PL/SQL**, and **JBoss**, applying continuous delivery principles
- **DevOps & Infrastructure**: Automate deployments and environments using **Docker** and **Kubernetes**
- **Quality Assurance**: Write clear documentation, meaningful tests, and reusable code
- **Team Collaboration**: Support cross-functional teams in identifying performance bottlenecks and scalability issues
