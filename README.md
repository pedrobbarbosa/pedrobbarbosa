# 👋 Hello there — I'm Pedro Barbosa

**Back-End Developer** focused on building scalable, resilient, and well-structured systems using **Java**, **Spring Boot**, and **SQL-based architectures**. Passionate about backend development, system modernization, and the intersection between clean code and real-world business logic.

Currently working at **SergipeTec**, where I design and implement critical features for tax and financial systems in public sector environments. My responsibilities include optimizing legacy applications, integrating APIs, and improving system observability in high-stakes production contexts.

## 💼 What I Do

- Design and develop RESTful APIs with **Java + Spring Boot**, following clean architecture and best practices
- Modernize and refactor legacy systems with **Java 6**, **PL/SQL**, and **JBoss**, applying continuous delivery principles in limited environments
- Automate deployments and environments using **Docker** and **Kubernetes**
- Write clear documentation, meaningful tests, and reusable code
- Support cross-functional teams in identifying performance bottlenecks and scalability issues

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack & Tools

- **Languages**: Java, PL/SQL, TypeScript, Python
- **Frameworks**: Spring Boot, Node.js, Flask
- **DevOps**: Docker, Kubernetes, GitLab CI/CD, Maven
- **Databases**: Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL
- **Other**: REST APIs, Swagger/OpenAPI, IntelliJ IDEA, Postman, Insomnia

## 🌎 Looking Ahead

I’m currently open to **international opportunities** that allow me to grow as a backend specialist, contribute to impactful products, and collaborate with global tech teams.

I bring a strong foundation in systems architecture, legacy transformation, and clean development practices — all supported by real-world experience in high-complexity environments.
